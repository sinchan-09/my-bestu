          how important you are to me, I can't wait to make so many more beautiful memory together,All i want to do is love and protect with every bone in my bod. i love you so mmuch nakchadhi(hasna mat semdi)
          
        </p>
        <p>
          You have taught me so much and always wished the best for me. You are
          one of the biggest reasons I could find my calling and follow my
          dreams. I must have done some good deeds in my previous life because,
          in this one, I have found a gem of a best friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          A true friend is a treasure that is hard to find. But I so am glad I
          found you! I’m blessed to have you as my friend. Thank you for always
          being there when nobody else was. I love you so much that words can
          never express the actual depth of my feelings. You are a herald of
          good fortune for me. Since we met, my life has changed for the better.
          You are my best friend, and no matter what, I will never let you go.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have touched my soul and made my life so valuable and joyful. With
          all the laughter and memories, you have added life to our friendship.
          I can hardly imagine a life without you, my precious one.
          Unfortunately, we don’t get to meet often, but I think of you during
          every high and low of my life. You are irreplaceable in my life, and I
          love you so much.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page" onclick="movePage(this, 6)">
        <p>
          Frankly, I can keep talking about you all day and night, and still be
          left with a million more things to say. You are the most amazing
          individual I have ever met. And I cannot envision my life without you
          in it. You are one of the greatest treasures of my life. I hope we
          continue being best friends till the last breaths of our lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want you to know that having a fantastic friend like you is a
          blessing. Your friendship is more valuable than all the treasures in
          the universe. I could never have imagined how you could have touched
          my heart in so many different ways, and I will always cherish our
          friendship with everything I have in me. I adore you, my lovely
          friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          I miss you when something good happens to me, and you aren’t there to
          share the moment. I miss when someone misunderstands me because you
          are the one who understands me the most. I miss you when I cry or
          laugh because you wipe my tears and make me laugh even more. I miss
          you always, but I miss you the most when I am alone, and I think about
          all the times we have spent with one another because I cherish those
          comforting memories always and forever in my heart.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="page text-page">
        <p>
          I adore you for everything you are, for all of our happy memories
          together, for our supportive interactions, and for all the ways you
          have helped me grow. I wouldn’t have it any other way because a friend
          like you is a rare diamond I dearly value. Love you, buddy. Words just
          can’t describe how much you mean to me.
